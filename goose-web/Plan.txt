MY PERSONAL WEBSITE

The objective of this site is to provide a bold and engaging introduction to myself as a Full Stack Developer, to showcase to 
prospective employers and freelance clients.

The site will be simple; a landing page which features a simple header with a circular profile image of me that intersects the header and the main
body of the page.

One page website, with a burger bar menu on the top left of the header, that helps the user navigate to whichever section of the page they wish to view.

The main body of the page will be split into 3 sections, each with a different background colour. The first section will be a short introduction to myself, the second will be a list of my skills, with images and logos of the technologies I am familiar with, and the third will be examples of recent projects I have worked on, with links to the live sites and the GitHub repositories.

The footer will contain links to my social media accounts, CV, and a contact form for users to get in touch with me.

COMPONENTS

The site will be built using React, and will be split into the following components:

- Header
- Main Page
- About Me
- Skills
- Projects
- Footer
