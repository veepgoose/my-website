            Hey there! I'm Victoria, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a background in business management and a decade of experience in the world of wine.

            I'm a creative problem solver who loves to learn and build new things. I'm excited to bring my unique perspective to the world of tech and to collaborate with others to create innovative solutions.

             <p>
             Coding is where my true passion lies. It's the realm where I bring my visionary app ideas to life, and I absolutely thrive in collaborative, forward-thinking environments that value creativity and embrace out-of-the-box thinking. But what sets me apart is not just my coding skillsâ€”it's my ability to work seamlessly in a team and my confidence in leading teams to success.
             </p>
             <p>
             With my entrepreneurial mindset and experience, I bring a unique perspective to every project. I love coming up with innovative ideas for apps that have the potential to make a positive impact in the world. From the initial planning and development stages to the final coding implementation, I'm a planner and a do-er who enjoys being involved in a project from conception to delivery. 
             </p>
             <p>
             Whether I'm working with a company or creating my own apps, I'm driven by the desire to bring something positive to the world. I believe that technology has the power to shape lives and communities, and I'm committed to using my skills to contribute to that positive change.  
             </p>
             <p>
             So, join me in this colourful journey! Let's collaborate, innovate, and create something extraordinary that leaves a lasting impact on the world. Together, we can make a difference.
